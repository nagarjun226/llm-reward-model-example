## 🎯 The Challenge

Can AI agents learn to sort objects by weight when the **threshold is hidden**? This repository compares three fundamentally different approaches through an intuitive sorting task that reveals the strengths and limitations of each AI paradigm.

**The Task**: Sort objects into buckets A (light), B (heavy), or C ("I don't know") based on a secret 10kg weight threshold.

## 🧠 Three AI Approaches, Three Philosophies

### 🎲 **Pure RL Agent** - *The Trial-and-Error Learner*
```python
class PureRLAgent:
    """Q-learning with function approximation"""
```
- **Strategy**: Starts completely blind, learns through rewards
- **Strengths**: Eventually discovers optimal threshold
- **Weaknesses**: Makes many catastrophic mistakes initially
- **Philosophy**: *"I'll figure it out through experience"*

### 🎭 **Static LLM Agent** - *The Reasoning Expert*
```python
class StaticLLMAgent:
    """GPT-powered reasoning without learning"""
```
- **Strategy**: Uses descriptions and physical intuition
- **Strengths**: Sensible decisions from day one
- **Weaknesses**: Cannot improve from feedback
- **Philosophy**: *"I know things, but I don't learn from mistakes"*

### 🔄 **LLM + Reward Hybrid** - *The Best of Both Worlds*
```python
class LLMWithRewardModel:
    """Combines reasoning with boundary learning"""
```
- **Strategy**: LLM reasoning + reward-based threshold learning
- **Strengths**: Starts smart, gets smarter
- **Weaknesses**: More complex to implement
- **Philosophy**: *"I reason AND learn from experience"*

## 📊 What You'll Discover

### 🏆 Performance Results
- **Pure RL**: 457 points (high accuracy after painful learning)
- **Static LLM**: 235 points (consistent but limited)
- **LLM + Reward**: 490 points (best of both worlds)

### 🎯 Threshold Learning
Watch agents discover the hidden 10kg boundary:
- **Pure RL**: Gradually converges from random start
- **LLM + Reward**: Refines initial estimates strategically
- **Static LLM**: Never learns (horizontal line)

### 📈 Key Insights
1. **Pure RL**: Optimal but dangerous - like deploying a blind robot
2. **Static LLM**: Safe but limited - like a stubborn expert
3. **Hybrid**: Future of AI - combining reasoning with learning

```

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### RL Implementation Details:
- **Algorithm**: Q-learning with linear function approximation
- **Features**: `[weight/20, (weight/20)², 1]` for non-linear boundaries
- **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy with decay (1.0 → 0.01)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 with temporal difference updates

### LLM Integration:
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo with structured JSON output
- **Fallback**: Simulated reasoning if no API key
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for consistent decision-making
- **Context**: System prompt with bucket descriptions

### Hybrid Learning:
- **Boundary Tracking**: Maintains A_upper and B_lower estimates
- **Strategic Exploration**: Focuses on uncertain weight ranges
- **LLM Fallback**: Uses reasoning when boundaries are unclear

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

This pattern appears in:
- **🤖 Robotics**: Combining planning with learning
- **🏥 Healthcare**: Medical knowledge + patient-specific learning
- **💰 Finance**: Market models + adaptive strategies
- **🎮 Game AI**: Rule-based behavior + learned optimizations

## 📈 Results Interpretation

### Why Hybrid Wins:
1. **Cold Start**: LLM provides sensible initial behavior
2. **Boundary Learning**: Reward feedback refines decisions
3. **Strategic Exploration**: Focuses learning where it matters most
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to reasoning when uncertain

### Why Pure RL Struggles Initially:
- Random exploration wastes many episodes
- No prior knowledge about the task
- Must discover everything from scratch
- High variance in early performance

### Why Static LLM Plateaus:
- Cannot adapt to the specific threshold
- Reasoning based on general knowledge only
- No mechanism to incorporate feedback
- Optimal for some tasks, suboptimal for others
